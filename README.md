# online-shop
This project provides an opportunity for a client to order goods online, as well as allows stores to manage data, add customers, products. If a client visits the store often, he will have a discount card and can get discounts, as well as there are regular customers. In a package called "Ð¡lients" the abstract class Customers is stored. They are bound to it and inherit its data classes as OrdinaryCustomer, PrimaryCustomer , RegularCustomer. Then in package Orders we have two classes: Order,OrderItem where we can get total prices of orders. Last package Products has 2 abstract classes Product and Memory and their child classes like CPUGPU,HDD,RAM,SSD,Smartphone. In these classes about products their memory and etc.In Main and Shop classes we are connecting to database PostgreSQL then doing things like adding product,adding clients, and making orders.
